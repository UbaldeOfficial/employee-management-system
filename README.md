## How Sessions Were Used
- Sessions are started on all protected pages to check if the user is logged in.  
- `auth_check.php` is included on every CRUD page to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Session IDs are regenerated on login to prevent session fixation.  

---

## How Cookies Were Used
- Optional "Remember Me" cookie stores a selector and validator for persistent login.  
- Validator is hashed before saving to the database.  
- Cookie expires after 30 days for security.  

---

## How Authentication is Secured
- Passwords are stored hashed using `password_hash()` (PHP).  
- Prepared statements are used for all database queries to prevent SQL injection.  
- Only logged-in users can access CRUD pages.  
- Input validation and sanitization are applied to all forms.
